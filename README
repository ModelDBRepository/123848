These are source files to generate the data in Figure 6 from
"Mossy fiber sprouting interacts with sodium channel
mutations to increase dentate gyrus excitability" Thomas EA, Reid CA, Petrou S,
Epilepsia (2009)

Intructions:
1) Build and install parplex (see Readme in the parplex directory)
2) python aradi.py
3) python mkdll.py Exp2Syn.c
4) python fig6.py

This will produce a number of ap*.dat. The columns of these files are:
Cellno APtime Celltype. You can use the enclosed Matlab scripts to plot them.
